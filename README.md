# React Native FlatList Re-rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug in React Native's FlatList component involving navigation and data updates. Navigating from within a FlatList item and then updating the data source can lead to incorrect re-rendering, causing stale data to be displayed. This is particularly noticeable with dynamic keys.

The `FlatListBug.js` file contains the buggy implementation, while `FlatListBugSolution.js` offers a corrected approach to ensure consistent UI updates.

## Bug Description
When you navigate from an item within a FlatList, and then subsequently update the list's data source, the FlatList may not properly re-render. This results in the display of old or incorrect data. The solution involves careful management of keys and potentially implementing a workaround to force re-rendering.
